### Technical Writing Tips and Tricks for students


And anybody else who wants to produce quality content
Written by Laura Roudge





As fresh Software Engineering students, we’re asked to write blog posts about different technical topics. For most of us, it’s the first time we learn about those topics AND it’s the first time we have to write blog posts. It’s definitely alright to feel scared about it; we all go through that feeling. Now that I have written a few articles, I realize just how much I like writing about what I learn. Although my writing still needs perfecting, I would still like to offer some of the tips and tricks I use to write technical posts for the curriculum assignments.

### Why good articles are important
When I do something, I first like to ask myself why I do it. In general, finding your why power is a good source of motivation. In the case of writing technical articles, it’s important to find a good why power that’s not “because it’s part of the assignment and my grades depend on it”. So here is a non-exhaustive list of examples of why writing neat blog posts is important:

### Future employers are likely to read them. This is one of the biggest motivations for me: just like your GitHub profile or your LinkedIn page, having good technical posts serves as a showcase for your skills.
It reinforces your knowledge of the concept you’re writing about. After researching a topic and then trying to reformulate it in your way, your brain is trained to think about that concept faster.
It’s a skill that not everybody has in tech. Not a lot of schools or bootcamps push their students to write technical articles, but it can be very appreciated by recruiters and you will be part of the happy few that write awesome articles about what they know!
Follow the assignment’s requirements
Okay, now that we know why we need to put effort in our technical writing, let’s look at a few rules of thumb to start off with. It goes without saying that in the scope of a curriculum project, you should always follow all the requirements in your article. It’s easy to go over and forget about them once you start writing, so make sure you re-check them before posting anything.


 ### Example of requirements for a blog post

Generally, all the blog post assignments share these requirements:

##### Have at least one picture
Publish on Medium or LinkedIn
Share on LinkedIn AND Twitter (Make sure you put the link to your tweet AND to your LinkedIn post along with the link to the article itself)
Write the article in English
Another tip I would like to share here is to not wait until the last possible minute to write your blog post, especially when you have three weeks to do it. Set weekly objectives, for example: “this week, I will write 500 words!” Sounds reasonably easy to stick to, right? You will always have better or more important things to do, but if you let the work pile up, it will be even more painful to get it done.

##### Go in detail
Whatever you’re writing about, always assume that the QA review will be looking for very specific details on the topic you’re writing about. Again, should you do it just because the grade depends on it? Of course not. When writing articles, think about it like discussing that topic with a professional that already knows about it. You don’t want to sound like you barely know the minimum.

So in your blog posts, make sure you explain every underlying concept in depth, it will make your writing more professional and precise. A good start is to give the definitions of the concept you’re introducing as you go. You can even quote a reference (as long as you share that reference of course).

##### Share your sources
This brings me to a very important tip: share your sources! It’s good to have a “Sources” section at the end of your article, where you can just copy-paste the links to the articles you read on that topic, or the videos you watched. Avoid Wikipedia as a source. While it’s great for initial research, is not always the best source of information and you might be sharing a link that doesn’t contain entirely true or precise information. What you can do is go to the bottom of the Wikipedia article and check out the links provided, for example.

Sharing your sources is also good for your image as a technical writer: it shows that you know how to look for information and rephrase concepts you learned somewhere. It’s also good to share credits to content creators you’re borrowing from: pictures, diagrams, etc. It’s their work, so putting their credits is a way of honoring that work.

* General style tips
A good blog post is also a beautiful blog post, so never take for granted the form! Here is a non-exhaustive list of tips for a pretty and neat article:

* Check your grammar and spelling. It goes without saying, but those mistakes are easier to make than you think!
* Use high-resolution images that are free. You can find awesome photos on Pexels or Unsplash.
* Use titles and headings of different sizes. This allows you to structure your thoughts and it makes the post much clearer.
* Use the “` before and after text to incorporate code examples. Like this: This is a code example.
* For bigger code snippets, use gists. Paste the link to your gist in your post and press enter. This way, you won’t lose the nice syntax highlights, and line numbers!
* Incorporate diagrams when needed. These are really great to describe a concept, and you can make beautiful ones on draw.io or miro.com. Flowcharts are a great way to explain an algorithm, but you can also use phase diagrams if you’re talking about time complexity for example.
* Be unique: choose your style!

Even though you can use these rules in your own articles, it is still important to develop your own style and stick to it. For example, I like using “we” in most of my articles and not address the reader directly, but you might like to address the reader and use “you/I”. The former makes your article more impersonal and maybe more professional, but the latter makes it more inclusive and fun, so it depends on which tone you want to use.

These details may seem unimportant, but writing is still a form of art! And true artists put themselves in their work, don’t they?



Writing technical articles is a great way of deepening your learning experience and expanding your visibility on social media. But in order to reach more people with your work, it’s important to follow a few simple rules, and I hope the ones I shared with you today will do the trick for you. Now that you know more about technical writing, go and impress your peers!
